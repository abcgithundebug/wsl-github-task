The Republic of India and the Russian Federation established bilateral relations in 1991 and remain close allies. Previously, during the Cold War, Indian–Soviet relations were considered a "strong strategic relationship". This diplomatic unity was further strengthened with both nations' shared military ideals, as well as their overall economic policies. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia kept the same close ties to India; in international terms, both nations Russia and India consider their mutual affinity to be a "strategic partnership". Their governments support the creation of a multipolar world order in which both nations are "poles".[1]

Traditionally, the Indian–Russian strategic partnership has been built on five major components: politics, defence, civil nuclear energy, anti-terrorism co-operation, as well as the advancement of and exploration of outer space travel.[2] These five major components were highlighted in a speech given by former Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai in Russia.[2]

The IRIGC (India-Russia Intergovernmental Commission) is the main body that conducts affairs at the governmental level between both countries.[3] Both countries are members of international bodies including the UN, BRICS, G20 and SCO.[4] Russia has stated that it supports India receiving a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.[5] In addition, Russia has expressed interest in joining SAARC with observer status in which India is a founding member.[6][7]

India is the second largest market for the Russian defence industry. In 2017, approximately 68% of the Indian military's hardware import came from Russia, making Russia the chief supplier of defence equipment.[8] India has an embassy in Moscow and two consulate-generals (in Saint Petersburg and Vladivostok). Russia has an embassy in New Delhi and six consulate-generals (in Chennai, Goa, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Trivandrum).[9]

According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 85% of Russians view India positively, with only 9% expressing a negative view.[10] Similarly, a 2017 opinion poll by the Moscow-based non-governmental think tank Levada-Center states that Russians identified India as one of their top five "friends", with the others being Belarus, China, Kazakhstan and Syria.[11] A 2022 poll showed that 60% of Indians support the Indian government's handling of the Russo-Ukrainian war.[12] A poll conducted in summer 2022 shows that Indians most frequently named Russia their most trusted partner, with 43% naming Russia as such compared to 27% who named the US.[13]wq
Goods uncovered from archaeological site such as Pazyryk indicates that nomads inhabiting the area conducted trading activities with India during 4th-3rd century BCE.[14] In 1468, Russian traveller Afanasy Nikitin began his journey to India. Between 1468 and 1472, he travelled through Persia, India and the Ottoman Empire but returned soon within three years from Indian subcontinent as he could not afford much to himself.qw
